                    Street, or a medieval mystic finding inspiration in a small study on the second floor
                    of a frame house on the vast, flat  checkerboard of endless streets. Nigeria has 774 local government areas
                    (L.G.As). Each local government area is administered by a Local Government
                    Council consisting of a chairman who is the Chief Executive of the LGA, and other
                    elected members who are referred to as Councillors.
